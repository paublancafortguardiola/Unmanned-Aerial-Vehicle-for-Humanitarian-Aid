# Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Humanitarian Aid 

## Introduction

### Aim

Our goal is to develop an innovative solution to assist governments worldwide in responding to natural disasters. We will design a revolutionary UAV with VTOL capabilities, engineered for rapid deployment, long-range missions, and versatile operations in disaster-affected areas. Additionally, we will establish an in-house remote piloting service to ensure seamless and efficient UAV operations, enabling immediate response capabilities in critical situations.

- The definition of the avionic systems (RADAR, GNSS, recovery systems, etc.) that will be equipped in the aircraft.
- The overall aircraft design: structural analysis, 3D blueprints elaboration, and material assessment.
- An aerodynamic analysis, including the main and tail rotors and the airframe.
- The choice of an adequate power plant and its justification based on performance and fuel efficiency, as well as an analysis of the electrical system of the aircraft.
- The definition of the payloads the UAV will be capable of carrying, as well as the operating procedures to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading.
- The analysis of the weight and balance of the aircraft.
- The study of the potential markets and clients.
- An economic analysis of the feasibility of the project, including a detailed budget.
- An overall breakdown of the solution aimed: the UAV and the piloting service.
- The study of the environmental and safety considerations of the project.

#### Excluded from the Design and Development

The design and development of the project will not include:
- The production and supply chain analysis and implementation.
- A study of the facilities placement and operational details.
- A deep aerodynamic analysis using CFD.
- A deep structural analysis using FEM.
- A detailed design of the aircraft and its components.

### Requirements

#### UAV Requirements

The UAV must:
- Have a VTOL capability to operate on rough terrains such as mountainous, forested, or earthquake-damaged areas.
- Be able to carry up to 3000 kg of payload (including medical personnel) while maintaining the maximum takeoff weight below 8000 kg.
- Reach a top speed of at least 300 km/h.
- Have an endurance of at least 5 hours with MPL and a minimum range of at least 300 km.
- Be able to withstand extreme conditions such as warlike or extreme weather environments.
- Be capable of transporting and deploying medical and rescue equipment, as well as carrying various types of humanitarian payloads.
- Be equipped to transport injured individuals, functioning as a UAV-ambulance.
- Be designed to minimize fuel consumption, reducing environmental impact and ensuring cost-effectiveness over the lifecycle of the vehicle.

#### Live Flight Simulator Requirements

The live flight simulator must:
- Be capable of real-time emulation of the vehicle’s environment to allow remote piloting as if operating live.
- Accurately replicate the UAV’s flight dynamics, environmental conditions, and system responses.

### Justification

When a natural disaster strikes, rapid response is crucial to minimizing human casualties and material damage, as emphasized by the United Nations OCHA. Our solution addresses this need by drastically reducing response times through the development of a UAV with VTOL capabilities, enabling quicker access to affected areas and faster air delivery. UAVs offer significant operational advantages by decoupling pilots from the aircraft, which enhances safety and efficiency. Remote control operations minimize risks and allow continuous service through shift rotations, ensuring uninterrupted response during critical moments.

The potential of this innovative UAV lies in addressing existing gaps in the disaster response market, combining heavy payload capabilities, medical support, and robust operational flexibility. As highlighted in the subsequent market study, no current UAV integrates all these features into a single platform. While existing solutions, such as lightweight medical drones or urban air mobility vehicles, meet individual needs, they fail to address the complex, multifaceted requirements of disaster response missions. Similarly, traditional heavy-lift helicopters, while effective, rely on onboard crews and have significant operational costs.

The proposed UAV represents a paradigm shift. By uniting VTOL functionality with the ability to transport heavy payloads, including injured individuals and medical supplies, it bridges the gap between current UAV limitations and the capabilities of conventional helicopters. Moreover, the absence of onboard crew reduces safety risks and operational costs, enhancing its viability for long-term disaster management strategies.

This justification is supported by insights from the market study, which follows this section. The analysis elaborates on the limitations of existing technologies and highlights the unmet demand for a comprehensive, versatile solution like the one proposed in this project. By addressing these market gaps, this UAV is poised to set a new benchmark in rapid, efficient, and cost-effective disaster response.
